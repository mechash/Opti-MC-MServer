# Optimised Minecraft Modpack for Raspberry Pi Server 


These instructions will guide you through the process of creating a modded Java Edition¬†Minecraft Server¬†on a RaspberryPi 3|4. 
I've put together a ModPack for this project that you may use for optimal gameplay while not overloading your little RaspberryPi Server. 
The modding scenario is entirely in the Java edition, and to connect to this server, you must be running Minecraft Java on a PC (Windows, Linux, or Mac).

Finally, these instructions are for Minecraft version 1.12.2. When it comes to mods, the version is everything, 
so make sure you get the correct version installed on both the client and server sides. If you want to add new mods to the server, follow the methods outlined here.
Because the regular Minecraft Java server is unable to execute the mods, we will need to download and install the appropriate version of Forge, which I will discuss later.


## Requirements

1. Desktop with Windows 10 / MAC
2. RaspberryPi 3/4 4GB+ 
3. Raspberry Pi OS Lite/Desktop 64-bit 
4. java development kit 8u321
5. Forge installer for server 
6. Curse Forge for client

> Disclaimer : 
> - This server was tested on RPi 4B 4GB, if you are planning to host more than 8 players on the server use 8GB varient for best performance. Raspberry Pi with 2GB is not recommended
> 
> - You wont be able to install jdk-8 on a 32-bit OS so make sure you are downloading and insalling Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit Desktop/Light version on Raspberry Pi


## Installation

[Server-End-Installation.md](/Server-End-Installation.md)

[Client-End-Installation.md](/Client-End-Installation.md)




## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits



List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.


üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
