   ```

> Note: if you are not sure about rpi_ip_address you should login to your router admin pannel and have a look over there.

### Step 3 : Update Raspberry Pi

- First update download information for the packages in the Raspberry Pi repository. 
  ```md
     sudo apt-get update 
  ```
- Now download and update the packages on the Raspberry Pi
    
  ```md
     sudo apt-get upgrade 
  ```
- Now Reboot

  ```md
     sudo reboot
  ```

### Step 4 : Cloning the repositoary to the raspberry pi home directoary

Before moving forward by setting up everyting we need to the repository on Raspberry Pi

```md
   git clone https://github.com/mechash/Opti-MC-MServer
```

### Step 5 :  Setting up java enviroment on Raspberry Pi

After updating RPi and cloning the directory lets begin the actual work to setup the server

- First change your work directoary to the one we have cloned in previous step

  ```md
     cd Opti-MC-MServer
  ```

- Move Java 8 ARM folder to /opt and change your directory 

  ```md 
     sudo mv Java\ 8\ ARM64/ /opt/
 
     cd /opt/Java\ 8\ ARM64/
  ```
- Extract the content of file jdk-8u321-linux-aarch64.tar.gz 
 
  ```md
     sudo tar -zxvf jdk-8u321-linux-aarch64.tar.gz
  ```
- setup the Java environment so that your system recognizes how to access the java binary

  ```md
     sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/opt/Java\ 8\ ARM64/jdk-16.0.2/bin/java 1
  ```

- Finally, check your version to make sure you are using the right one

  ```md
     java -version
  ```
  
  You should get someting like this
  
  ```md
     java version "1.8.0_321"
     Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_321-b07)
     Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.321-b07, mixed mode)  
  ```
