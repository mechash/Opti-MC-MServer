## Installation 

These steps will help you to setup the ModPack on the Client end Minecraft.

### Step 1 : Install Curse Forge

- Download the curse forge app from the [official website](https://download.curseforge.com/)

- Install and Launch the application 

### Step 2 : Setting Up profile in Curse Forge Launcher

Follow the flow to setup the new custom profile for the ModPack

- Home -> Select Minecraft -> Create Custom Profile 

- `Name_Your_Profile` -> Select Minecraft version `1.12.2` -> Game Type `Forge` -> Modloader Version `forge-14.23.5.2860` -> Create

### Step 3 : Adding Modpack to the Profile 

- Click on the Profile you created in the previous step

- Click on more options besides the play button - > click on Open Folder

- Now windows explorer should open the profile directory 

  (Here you can see 1 folder with the name `mods` and 1 file with the name `minecraftinstance`)

- Now go into the mods folder this folder should be empty (to add any mods we have to add the mod file into this folder) 
  
- So to add mods to Minecraft we will download the contents from the `Client-End-Mods` from this repository if you are not able to find it here is the [link](https://github.com/mechash/Opti-MC-MServer/Client-End-Mods/)

- Once you have added the files into the folder you can close the file explorer and go back to the Cures Forge launcher

- Click on `Play` and it will run the Minecraft launcher, once you have signed in to your account click on `PLAY`

- It will take a little time and the game will be up and running
